<p><strong>Background:</strong> A <u>user</u> downloads and installs a <u>system</u> of program files, mostly ado-files, which form the foundation of most of the commands used in Stata Programming. Using those commands and additional syntax written out sequentially in a do-file, the user creates well-formed instruction to Stata called a do-file script. Once the user runs this script, results are generated and displayed in the results window, in a graph, or in a format (<code>.xlsx</code>, <code>.log</code>, <code>.dta</code>, <code>.docx</code>, <code>.md</code>, <code>LaTeX</code>, <code>.html</code>, etc). The <code>.html</code> file format is of specific interest since its the pathway to self-publication. To illustrate how this may be achieved in Stata, we hereby introduce the <code>dyndoc</code> command.</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> This is a simulated dataset. This simulation drew values for age from both normal distribution and t-distribution. There are 30 observations in total. Distribution graph is shown below.In the simulation data, the age variable is generated according to a normal distribution, specifically:** Age, years</sub> ~ N(μ = 57, σ<sup>2</sup> = 225)</p>
